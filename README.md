# OOPS
In Python, Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming.
It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance. polymorphism, encapsulation, etc in the programming.
The amin concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

# Main Concepts
1. Class
2. Objects
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Data Abstraction

# Real World Explanation
* **Poly** --> Many | **Morphism** --> Structure
* **Inherit** --> To receive a quality, charecteristic, etc. from your parents
* **Encapsulation** --> The action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule
* **Abstraction** --> The act of removing something from something else
